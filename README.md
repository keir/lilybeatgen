# Generate rhythms for music practice

I'm learning guitar, so of course instead of practicing rhythms I am writing
code to generate rhythms to practice. The project intent is to produce rhythm
lines similar to the ones in The Rhythm Bible by Dan Fox, but an unlimited
number for each category. So far, basic plumbing is in place to generate
syntatically correct Lilypond scores in the style of the Rhythm Bible. The
rhythms are sometimes nonsensical; if I find the time future revisions will try
to create more convential scores.
